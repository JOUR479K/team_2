Two best ideas
DC Metro incidents
WMATA has APIs that return reported incidents. One of them reports Rail Incidents and the line in which they happen, with description of the incident type. The data is updated every 20 to 30 seconds. The minimum viable thing we could envision building are Twitter bots for each line that tweet out whenever an incident is happening in that line.
