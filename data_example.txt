This is the example of the data supplied by the WMATA API. We managed to pull data like this, but couldnâ€™t save it. When an incident is resolved, the json about it is not supplied anymore. We need to create a list that keeps all the data that is pulled.


{
    "Incidents": [
        {
            "DateUpdated": "2010-07-29T14:21:28",
            "DelaySeverity": null,
            "Description": "Red Line: Expect residual delays to Glenmont due to an earlier signal problem outside Forest Glen.",
            "EmergencyText": null,
            "EndLocationFullName": null,
            "IncidentID": "3754F8B2-A0A6-494E-A4B5-82C9E72DFA74",
            "IncidentType": "Delay",
            "LinesAffected": "RD;",
            "PassengerDelay": 0,
            "StartLocationFullName": null
        }
    ]
}
